# Docker
The fastest way to deploy PictShare is via the [official Docker package](https://github.com/HaschekSolutions/pictshare/pkgs/container/pictshare)

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 -e "TITLE=My own PictShare" -e "URL=http://localhost/" ghcr.io/hascheksolutions/pictshare
```

## Usage

### Building it
```bash
docker build -t pictshare -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

### Quick start
```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name=pictshare ghcr.io/hascheksolutions/pictshare
```

### Persistent data
```bash
mkdir /data/pictshareuploads
chown 1000 -R /data/pictshareuploads
docker run -d -v /data/pictshareuploads:/var/www/data -p 80:80 --name=pictshare ghcr.io/hascheksolutions/pictshare
```

### Persistent data with increased max upload size
```bash
mkdir /data/pictshareuploads
chown 1000 -R /data/pictshareuploads
docker run -d -e "MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=1024" -v /data/pictshareuploads:/var/www/data -p 80:80 --name=pictshare ghcr.io/hascheksolutions/pictshare
```
